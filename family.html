					<h3>Geralt of Rivia</h3>
					<p>
						Also known as the White Wolf, Geralt is the orphaned son of a
						sorceress, a rare oddity considering sorceresses are said to be
						infertile. He is easily identified by his white hair, a side-effect
						of his own particularly brutal ordeal during the Trial of Grasses as
						a child. Geralt's life has been marked by destiny, manifested in
						many chance encounters that have dragged this Witcher into
						larger-than-life events. His fate is bound to that of the sorceress
						Yennefer, thanks to his last-ditch attempt at saving her
						life,(described in the short story, The Last Wish. Geralt is also
						the adoptive father of Ciri, whom he has raised, trained, and cared
						for as though she were his own daughter. Despite his rough exterior
						and hard demeanor, this antihero is a big softy with a huge heart

					<h3>Cirilla</h3>
					<p>
						lso called the Lion Cub of Cintra, Cirilla is Geralt's adopted
						daughter. She was claimed before birth by the Witcher after he
						invoked the Law of Surprise, a ritual whereby an unborn child is
						sometimes claimed by a Witcher as a reward for services rendered.
						Geralt never truly intended on taking her away from her parents, but
						destiny saw to it that little Ciri ended up in his care anyway,
						after her parents left her with her grandmother, Queen Calanthe of
						Cintra, who was subsequently killed by Nilfgaardian soldiers. Ciri,
						due to her lineage, is the rightful heir to the thrones of both
						Cintra and Nilfgaard, among various other royal entitlements. The
						young princess, however, displayed no interest in these titles.
						Having been raised by Witchers and educated by the sorceress
						Yennefer, Ciri wished only to become a Witcher and set out on her
						own path. Unfortunately for her, she also carries the blood of Lara
						Dorren, an elven sorceress and distant relative. This "Elder Blood"
						is Ciri's defining characteristic and what makes her arguably the
						most important character of all, around whose life all others
						revolve

					<h3>Yennefer</h3>
					<p>
						Ciri's adoptive mother and Geralt's long time lover, Yennefer of
						Vengerberg is a powerful and ambitious sorceress. She has been
						instrumental in helping Ciri control and channel the immense power
						of the child's Elder Blood. Her fate is bound to that of Geralt due
						to an event known as the Last Wish. This magical bond formed the
						basis of their love for one another, but it could be argued that
						destiny brought them together regardless of the magical component.
						They share a tempestuous relationship, however, and lead very
						separate lives. Known for her raven hair, violet eyes, and scent of
						lilac and gooseberries, Yennefer has aligned herself with.....
